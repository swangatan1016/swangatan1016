<h1> About </h1>
<p> Snow globes are such a amusing object that can make your day. They are meant to be shaken and yet so many of them are fragile and over-price and we’re always telling kids not to touch. That’s just unexceptable. What if we make a snow globe that was meant to be shaken? What if it was a craft that kids could make themselves!?! Now that’s an idea!
